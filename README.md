## About index.html
This file demonstrates a simple responsive web page layout using HTML and CSS.

### Structure
- **Header**: Displays the main title "Cities" with a large font and colored background.
- **Section**: Contains two main columns:
  - **Navigation (nav)**: On the left, a vertical menu with links to different cities (London, Paris, Tokyo). Uses an unordered list for easy navigation.
  - **Article**: On the right, displays information about London, including a heading and two descriptive paragraphs.
- **Footer**: A colored bar at the bottom with the text "Footer".

### CSS Features
- **Box Sizing**: All elements use `box-sizing: border-box` for easier sizing and layout.
- **Fonts**: Uses Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif for a clean, modern look.
- **Header/Footer Styling**: Both have custom background colors, padding, and centered white text.
- **Columns**: The navigation and article sections float side by side, with the nav taking 30% width and the article 70%. Both have padding and background colors for separation.
- **Responsive Design**: A media query ensures that on screens smaller than 600px, the columns stack vertically and take full width, making the layout mobile-friendly.
- **List Styling**: The navigation menu removes default list styles and padding for a cleaner look.
- **Clearfix**: Uses `section::after` with `clear: both` to ensure the layout doesn't break due to floating elements.

### How it works
- The layout is ideal for simple informational sites or as a template for more complex pages.
- The navigation can be expanded with more links or made interactive with JavaScript.
- The article section can be replaced with any content relevant to the selected menu item.
- The responsive design ensures usability on both desktop and mobile devices.

This file is a good starting point for learning about basic web layouts, CSS floats, and responsive design.
